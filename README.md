## Design  

*from http://oceanadapt.rutgers.edu/about_us/*  

#### Impact
To provide information about the impacts of changing climate and other factors on the distribution of marine life to the National Climate Assessment

#### Users
  - Fisheries communities
    - Why will this user care?
  - Policymakers
    - Why will this user care?

#### Overview  
  - Hosts an annually updated database of scientific surveys in the United States 
  - Provides tools for exploring changes in marine fish and invertebrate distribution

  - > prototype notes:
    >  - Full species list by region is now available by default when you expand options. In order to make it easy to browse, I made a scroll bar within the listing section. Then filtering options narrows the list.
    >  - I made your edits to the filter section, but a few questions:
    >    - Do ALL fish fall into either Commercial or Recreational. Basically I'm wondering now that I have made 3 columns, should these be radio buttons?
    >  - For the Projections, I think with this revised filtering section, the same filtering can apply to this list of 300. 
    >  - Can you remind me where the EPA report link should go? Why is it important? Is it just an external link?
    >  - I adjusted the Projection map to match reality.
