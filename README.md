## Design

- [Prototype](https://sketch.cloud/s/J87d9/all/page-1/home/play)
  - > prototype notes:
    >  - Full species list by region is now available by default when you expand options. In order to make it easy to browse, I made a scroll bar within the listing section. Then filtering options narrows the list.
    >  - I made your edits to the filter section, but a few questions:
    >    - Do ALL fish fall into either Commercial or Recreational. Basically I'm wondering now that I have made 3 columns, should these be radio buttons?
    >  - For the Projections, I think with this revised filtering section, the same filtering can apply to this list of 300. 
    >  - Can you remind me where the EPA report link should go? Why is it important? Is it just an external link?
    >  - I adjusted the Projection map to match reality.
